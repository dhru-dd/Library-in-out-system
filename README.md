# Library-in-out-system
The Library In–Out System is a Flutter mobile app designed to digitize the process of student entry and exit from the college library. Each student logs in to the app and uses a QR code to mark their entry and exit automatically — eliminating manual registers.
=======

# Project Description

**Library In–Out System** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to **manage and monitor students' entry and exit in a library efficiently**. Using **QR code scanning** and **Firebase authentication**, the app allows students to mark their presence and departure in real-time while keeping a **secure digital record of all activities**.

## Features

- **Real-time IN/OUT tracking** – Students can scan a QR code when entering or leaving the library.  
- **User authentication** – Uses Firebase Authentication to ensure only registered users can access the system.  
- **Activity history** – Students can view their personal library entry and exit history.  
- **Dark mode UI** – Elegant, minimalistic design for a smooth user experience.  
- **Safe data storage** – All data is securely stored in **Firebase Firestore**, ensuring integrity and accessibility.

### Future Enhancements

- **Admin Panel for Librarians:**  
  - View the **number of students currently in the library**.  
  - Track **active students** in real-time.  
  - Access **complete records** of all students’ library entries and exits.  

- **User Features:**  
  - View **total time spent in the library** over a day, week, or month.  
  - Get **personalized activity summaries** for better time management.  

- **Additional Improvements:**  
  - Notifications for students when they enter/leave the library.  
  - Analytics for librarians to optimize library usage.
